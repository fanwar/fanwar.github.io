One recent project I've started on is a custom chat application written in Node.js. I spent a bit of time looking in to the right mix of technologies to use to bootstrap this project and came up with the following.

* **[express](http://expressjs.com/)** as my web application framework. It is a fully featured framework that can be used to build full client-facing websites as well as backend APIs. 
* **[sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/)** as an ORM layer that helps me interface with a Postgres database in the backend.
* **[React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)** as a FE client framework
* **[socket.io](socket.io)** to support some real-time features that I want to test out (main reason I'm building chat). 

Stay tuned for updates on how things go!
